Therefore, I am unable to make a concrete, well-informed detail report based on the given text. However, I can provide general theoretical insights on the long-tail SEO strategy that could be beneficial for websites like puertoricomove.com.

Long-tail SEO is a technique that focuses on targeting less competitive, highly specific search terms (or keywords). In the context of "puertoricomove.com," which seems to be related to real estate or relocation services in Puerto Rico, the long-tail SEO strategy would involve using specific keywords that are relevant to their service. 

For example, instead of using highly competitive keywords like "Puerto Rico real estate," long-tail SEO strategy might involve using more specific terms like "beachfront properties for sale in San Juan Puerto Rico," or "relocation services for retirees in Puerto Rico." These long-tail keywords might have lower search volumes, but they can drive highly targeted traffic that is more likely to convert into customers.

To implement long-tail SEO, companies need to conduct comprehensive keyword research, which involves identifying the specific phrases potential customers are likely to use when looking for their services. Useful tools for this process include Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, and Ahrefs.

The content on the website should be optimized to include these long-tail keywords. However, keyword usage should be natural and meaningful. Search engines penalize keyword stuffing, which is the overuse of keywords in an attempt to manipulate a website's rankings.

In addition to including long-tail keywords in the site's content, it should also be used in meta descriptions, headers, and image alt texts to further boost the site's SEO.

It's also recommended to regularly add fresh, high-quality content to the site that incorporates these long-tail keywords. This not only helps to rank for these terms but also provides value to site visitors, which can increase their dwell time and boost the site's overall SEO. Blogging, creating informative guides, FAQ pages, and updating old content are all effective strategies to include these keywords.

However, SEO is not a one-time process. It requires regular monitoring and adjustment. SEO professionals should regularly track the performance of their keywords and adjust their strategies accordingly.

In conclusion, while the text provided did not furnish the specific insight necessary for a robust analysis of the SEO for puertoricomove.com, understanding the concept and implementation of long-tail keywords can be a highly effective strategy for any business looking to improve their online visibility and, in doing so, drive a more targeted customer base to their website.
