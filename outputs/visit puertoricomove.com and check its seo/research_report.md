The data provided does not contain any specific details about "puertoricomove.com" or its Search Engine Optimization (SEO) performance. The information available is error messages related to failed attempts to access different websites using a Google Chrome browser. SEO performance involves a study of parameters like keyword optimization, backlinks, traffic, and user engagement on a specific website. Therefore, without appropriate successful data gathered from sites like "puertoricomove.com", it's impracticable to create an analytical report based on SEO performance.

However, the errors in the provided text suggest a technical issue with the ChromeDriver. The recurring theme in the messages is "Chrome failed to start: was killed" and "(The process started from chrome location is no longer running, so ChromeDriver is assuming that Chrome has crashed.)". These messages indicate that the ChromeDriver was unable to open and run Google Chrome successfully.

Common reasons for this problem could be an incompatibility between the versions of ChromeDriver and Google Chrome or a system issue preventing Google Chrome from launching. Another potential cause is that there might be some issue with the configuration of the ChromeDriver or the environment in which it's being run.

It is crucial to rectify these technical issues before attempting to gather data for SEO analysis. These errors are fundamental to the data collection process, and it would be meaningless to report on the SEO performance of a website without successfully accessing it first.

Resolving these errors may potentially involve updating the version of ChromeDriver or Google Chrome in use, checking local system permissions, or altering the setup of the testing or data collection environment.

In terms of formulating a report, it's essential to remember that an in-depth SEO report would typically involve an analysis of various aspects of a website. This can include its keyword usage and optimization, the number and quality of backlinks, the amount and source of traffic, user engagement and behavior, and performance on mobile devices. The report should be structured logically, perhaps with separate sections for each of these major categories, and aim to provide detailed, informative insight based on available data. Where possible, the use of relevant statistics can help to illustrate key points and trends.

Due to the nature of the source information provided, it's not feasible to generate an APA citation for this report. In standard practice, an APA citation for a website might look something like this:

Author. (Year, Month Day). Title of page. Site Name. URL

However, the text provided does not supply this information, as the text is composed of error messages rather than content from a specific author or page.
